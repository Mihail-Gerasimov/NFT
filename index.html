                        controversy and myth
                        surrounding this breed, all because of the notorious history of its origin. Bull terriers were
                        initially bred for dog fighting, thus the dog breed was deliberately made to be angry and
                        aggressive. As a result, they were very feared and avoided in 1850 England. However, only few
                        people know that aggression used to be mainly imposed on dogs by people , not vice versa.
                        Even though the occurrences mentioned above happened a long time ago and it has already been 80
                        years since the breed stoped being considered a "fighter" , but a companion breed, most people
                        still consider bull terriers dangerous to society.

                    <img class="mb-3 mb-sm-0" src="./img/3-bull-terrier/description-2.png" alt="">
                    <p class="paw-text text-center text-sm-start">However, bull terriers have another problem which is
                        way worse and scarier than
                        the society-imposed aggression. Due to the extreme structure of the skull, this breed often has
                        neurological diseases that are still hardly understood, even in Europe.
                        Many dogs, regardless of their breed, suffer from such neurological diseases. But the story of
                        one particular bull terrier with a tough fate has become the basis for the creation of this
                        collection.

                    happiness, Satan's helper and the devil's spawn all rolled into one doggie named Bublick. His
                    appearance
                    in the family was extremely long-awaited , but at the same time not entirely rational. The

                    from staying at home and boredom during the lockdown accelerated the process of acquiring a dog,
                    which

                        dream of keeping a dog was about to be fulfilled. And then , after many hurdles, that
                        long-awaited and sweet bundle of happiness was finally home! Everyone was on cloud nine , until
                        the moment they noticed strange scars on the dog’s body. What the scars were and where did they
                        come from was unclear. The owner of the kennel, obviously expecting receiving those questions,
                        did not get in touch.After visiting a number of doctors, cynologists and bull terrier
                        specialists, we came to the conclusion that those the scars from the bites happened at an early
                        age.

                                The relapses initially would happen once or twice a day. It eventually escalated to the
                                point where at the relapses’s peak such "attacks" would happen every 10 minutes.

                                Bublick went out of control,ended up not trusting us, at home he was completely
                                uncontrollable. The “attacks” would repeatedly happen every day and night, he was
                                growling
                                all the time, snapping, chasing his tail, biting himself until he started bleeding. He
                                was
                                not being able to fall asleep, neither were we.

                                We had visited approximately a dozen of doctors, cynologists, but no one knew what the
                                issue
                                was and how to treat it.
                                As time went by nothing changed. A lot of money had been spent, many tears had been shed
                                due
                                to despair and lack of comprehension of how to continue to live with such a dog.
                                <br><br>
                                It was becoming more and more difficult with every day. We had different thoughts. All
                                the
                                methods which had been used did not work. Later on even started thinking about putting
                                the
                                dog away began to come on mind .
                                <br><br>
                                What would you do if you were in our shoes ?
                                Just imagine having a dog by your side that you can not control. A dog which snaps every
                                10
                                minutes during the night and starts barking loudly, biting its tail till it’s bleeding
                                and
                                not responding or reacting at all. The dog which at an unfortunate moment may also bump
                                into
                                your hand instead of it’s own tail and accidentally bite it. The dog which is in a weird
                                state, suffers and you have no way to help. All in all, we were trying to find the
                                solution
                                over and over again. We wrote, called and met with different specialists. We never gave
                                up
                                and hoped to find someone who could help. Subsequently after six months of agony it
                                finally
                                happened. The neurologist at the Moscow clinic, who by that time had already dealt with
                                three similar cases, gave us a hand in terms of understanding the situation.
                                <br><br>
                                Such behavior has no diagnosis, it's simply because our dog's psyche has been disturbed
                                and
                                nothing can be done about it. It is not curable, it will remain forever, you can only
                                muffle
                                this condition by making your dog take pills for lifetime and exposing it to a stable
                                daily
                                training.
                                <br><br>
                                We started the training right from the first day the puppy was delivered to our home.
                                The
                                dog was trained in obedience , endurance and tricks. Later on we chose an interesting
                                NoseWork discipline - the process of a dog using its natural desire to hunt in order to
                                determine and detect different scents such as the scent of cinnamon. We even took part
                                in
                                competitions and continued to develop our dog’s skills in this direction.
                                <br><br>
                                This is how our long and thorny path of treatment began; the path which in general will
                                never end, however, we do not lose hope, we continue to give the pills to the dog and
                                train
                                him hard instead.
                                Thanks to the medicine , training and other activities, Bublick has become more
                                stress-resilient and obedient. The connection has been reestablished between us, and as
                                a
                                result, life has become much easier!
                                <br><br>
                                I do hope that after reading this text you have managed to obtain faith that all life's
                                obstacles and hardships can be overcome. The main thing is not to despair and always try
                                all
                                the options.
